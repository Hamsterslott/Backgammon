Backgammon


The object in backgammon is to move all of your checkers around the board 
into your home board and then bear them off. 
The first player to get all their checkers off the board is the winner. 


The following rules apply:

A checker may be moved only to an open point, 
one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. 

The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves.

A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. 
A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use.

A player must use up all of the dice rolls if this is legally possible.
When only one number can be played, the player must play that number.

Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, 
his first obligation is to enter those checker(s).





Good luck and have fun!
